Home in the World : International Migration and Development in Contemporary Ghana and West Africa -- Emanating from an international conference on migration and development convened by the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana, Legon, the UNDP and the Royal Netherlands Embassy, this collection of papers considers topics such as: patterns of migration in West Africa; the Dutch perspective on contemporary migration; the macroeconomic impact of remittances; the impact of the brain drain on the health and higher education sectors in Ghana; the religious dimension of migration; and the role of diaspora-based organisations in socio-economic development. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n The African Christian and Islam -- During the summer of 2010 Ghana played host to the first ever conference held within Africa to focus solely on the relationship of the African Christian and Islam. The event was led by John Azumah in partnership with the Center of Early African Theology. The conference, chaired by Archbishop John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan of Abuja welcomed over 50 participants from across 27 African countries and several denominations. This book is a collection of the papers presented by 22 of the delegates forming a historical survey and thematic assessment of the African Christian and Islam. In addition, key information on the introduction, spread and engagement of Islam and Christianity within 9 African countries is presented. The book closes with Biblical reflections that opened each day of the conference, providing useful examples of Christians reading the Bible in reference to Islam. \n\n\n\n\nPhytoremediation of Metal-Contaminated Soils -- This is the first book aimed at development of a common language among scientists working in the field of Phytoremediation. Authors of the main chapters are leading scientists in this field. Some of them were among the first ones to have suggested the use of hyperaccumulator plants for extraction of metals from soils. Manuscripts based on lectures presented at the ASI have been revised here to take into account ASI participants' comments and suggestions. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Energetics of Organometallic Species -- An overview of modern organometallic thermochemistry, made by some of the most active scientists in the area, is offered in this book. The contents correspond to the seventeen lectures delivered at the NATO ASI Energetics of Organometallic Species (Curia, Portugal, September 1991), plus three other invited contributions from participants of that summer school. These papers reflect a variety of research interests, and discuss results obtained with several techniques. It is therefore considered appropriate to add a few preliminary words, attempting to bring some unity out of that diversity. In the first three chapters, results obtained by classical calorimetric methods are described. Modern organometallic thermochemistry started in Manchester, with Henry Skinner, and his pioneering work is briefly surveyed in the first chapter. The historical perspective is followed by a discussion of a very actual issue: the trends of stepwise bond dissociation enthalpies. Geoff Pilcher, another Manchester thermochemist, makes, in chapter 2, a comprehensive and authoritative survey of problems found in the most classical of thermochemical techniques - combustion calorimetr- applied to organometallic compounds. Finally, results from another classical technique, reaction-solution calorimetry, are reviewed in the third chapter, by Tobin Marks and coworkers. More than anybody else, Tobin Marks has used thermochemical values to define synthetic strategies for organometallic compounds, thus indicating an application of thermochemical data of which too little use has been made so far. \n\n\n\n\nPearl Millet : Properties, Functionality and its Applications -- Pearl millet is mainly used for animal and poultry feed. It is the principal source of energy, protein, vitamins, minerals and contains many phenolic compounds, which are a good source of natural antioxidants. Pearl millet is a rich source of bioactive compounds and contains phytates and polyphenols. Owing to high nutritional and phytochemical properties, it has gained considerable attention as a botanical dietary supplement in many functional foods. Pearl Millet: Properties, Functionality and Its Applications provides comprehensive knowledge on nutritional and non-nutritional aspects of pearl millet. It covers recent research on pearl millet and provides information to improve the property and shelf life of flour, as well as the starch, and their uses in various food products. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Milk : Its Remarkable Contribution to Human Health and Well-being -- Milk is the one food that sustains life and promotes growth in all newborn mammals, including the human infant. By its very nature, milk is nutritious. Despite this, it has received surprisingly little attention from those interested in the cultural impact of food. In this fascinating volume, Stuart Patton convincingly argues that milk has become of such importance and has so many health and cultural implications that everyone should have a basic understanding of it. This book provides this much-needed introduction. Patton's approach to his subject is comprehensive. He begins with how milk is made in the lactating cell, and proceeds to the basics of cheese making and ice cream manufacture. He also gives extensive consideration to human milk, including breasts, lactation, and infant feeding. Pro and con arguments about the healthfulness of cows' milk are discussed at length and with documentation. Patton explores the growing gap between the public's impressions of milk, and known facts about milk and dairy foods. He argues that the layperson's understanding of milk has deteriorated as a result of propaganda from activists anxious to destroy milk's favorable image, misinformation in the media, and scare implications from medical research hypotheses. \n\n\n\n\nBack Pain Relief : Chinese Qigong for Healing and Prevention -- Young or old, sedentary or athletic; it is likely that you will experience some sort of back pain injury in your lifetime. Since the spine is the root of all motion, a healthy back is vital to well-being.  Although Western Medicine has made great progress in treating spinal illnesses and lower back pain, it has only limited success in actually healing it.  Chinese Medicine, over the last four thousand years, has developed many of its own methods to treat spine problems, including Qigong exercises, acupuncture, massage, and herbal treatments. By doing Qigong exercises, you can effectively treat many cases of spinal illnesses and rebuild the strength of your torso, which is the root of complete healing.  This book introduces Qigong exercises that can restore the health of the spine. Some of the exercises are designed to heal a condition, others to help rebuild the strength of the joints, still others to help keep the back healthy and prevent further problems from developing. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Chi Nei Tsang : Chi Massage for the Vital Organs -- The techniques of Chi Nei Tsang evolved in Asia during an era when few physicians were available and people had to know how to heal themselves. Many people today have symptoms that modern medicine is not able to cure because a physical source for the problem is not easily found. The energies of negative emotions, stress, and tension--all common in modern life--and the weight of past illness accumulate in the abdominal center, causing energy blockages and congestion. When this occurs, all vital functions stagnate and myriad problems arise. By practicing the techniques of Chi Nei Tsang, this stagnation is removed and the vital organs surrounding the navel center are detoxified and rejuvenated. Master Chia teaches readers how to avoid absorbing negative energies from others and take full charge of their health through the self-healing techniques of Chi Nei Tsang. He offers fully illustrated exercises that show how to detoxify the internal organs and clear the energy (chi) channels throughout the body. He also presents methods for balancing emotions, managing stress, and observing the body in order to recognize, ameliorate, and prevent maladies before they become a problem. \n\n\n\n\nProud Peacock Lined Journal : Medium Lined Journaling Notebook, Proud Peacock Violet Feathers Pattern Cover, 6x9,\" 130 Pages -- Proud Peacock Journal - A 6x9\" Size Journaling Notebook.

Schiele (1890-1918) was a painter known for full-frontal portraits of naked women (and on many occasions, himself). They were stark and disturbing. He painted his subjects in gaunt, twisting and unnatural poses. Their voyeuristic tone and blatant eroticism outraged society, landing him in prison for 24 days. Nevertheless, his works would have a strong influence on the development of expressionist art. 'Egon Schiele' focuses on the artist's creative years, the development of his talent, his relationships with other artists, including Gustav Klimt, the women in his life and his obsession with making provocative art. Quickly following Schiele's early successes were his failures. In the end, it was the Spanish flu that killed him at the tragically young age of 28. 'Egon Schiele' is a seductive and intimate portrait of an artistic genius who was both lauded and condemned for his brilliance. His works, at one time judged to be disgusting and perverse, are now considered masterpieces and are in museums all around the world. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Nature and the Nation in Fin-de-Siecle France : The Art of Emile Galle and the Ecole de Nancy -- By the time of his death in 1904, critics, arts reformers, and government officials were near universal in their praise of Art Nouveau designer Emile Galle (1846-1904), whose works they described as the essence of French design. Many even went so far as to argue that the artist's creations could reinvigorate France's fading arts industries and help restore its economic prosperity by defining a modern style to represent the nation. For fin-de-siecle viewers, Galle's works constituted powerful reflections on the idea of national belonging, modernity, and the role of the arts in political engagement. While existing scholarship has largely focused on the artist's innovative technical processes, a close analysis of Galle's works brings to light the surprisingly complex ways in which his fragile creations were imbricated in the political turmoil that characterized fin-de-siecle France. Examining Galle's works inspired by Japanese art, his patriotically inflected designs for the Universal Exposition of 1889, his artistic manifesto in support of Dreyfus created in 1900, and finally, his late works that explore the concept of evolution, this book reveals how Galle returns again and again to the question of national identity as the central issue in his work. \n\n\n\n\nSNOWBOARDING KNOW HOW -- Offers a brief history of snowboarding, looks at snowboards and related equipment, and demonstrates gliding, turning, and jumping skills \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Snowboarding Freestyle Tricks, Skills and Techniques -- Snowboarding: Freestyle Tricks, Skills and Techniques takes you through each of the tricks using a step-by-step approach with truly stunning action photography sequences showing each of the tricks in close-up detail.

Its wines are the global gold standard, prized by collectors, and its winemaking regions each offer unique tasting experiences, from the spice of Bordeaux to the berry notes of the Loire Valley. Although grape variety, climate, and the skill of the winemaker are essential in making good wine, the foundation of a wine's character is the soil in which its grapes are grown. Who could better guide us through the relationship between the French land and the wine than a geologist, someone who deeply understands the science behind the soil? Enter scientist Charles Frankel. In Land and Wine, Frankel takes readers on a tour of the French winemaking regions to illustrate how the soil, underlying bedrock, relief, and microclimate shape the personality of a wine. The book's twelve chapters each focus in depth on a different region, including the Loire Valley, Alsace, Burgundy, Champagne, Provence, the Rhone Valley, and Bordeaux, to explore the full meaning of terroir. \n\n\n\n\nJunie B.

The trouble is, we're living in a world that insists we be one or the other.\" With these words, Kate Bornstein ushers readers on a funny, fearless, and wonderfully scenic journey across the terrains of gender and identity. On one level, Gender Outlaw details Bornstein's transformation from heterosexual male to lesbian woman, from a one-time IBM salesperson to a playwright and performance artist. But this particular coming-of-age story is also a provocative investigation into our notions of male and female, from a self-described nonbinary transfeminine diesel femme dyke who never stops questioning our cultural assumptions.  Gender Outlaw was decades ahead of its time when it was first published in 1994. Now, some twenty-odd years later, this book stands as both a classic and a still-revolutionary work--one that continues to push us gently but profoundly to the furthest borders of the gender frontier.  With a new introduction \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Being and Becoming Professionally Other : Identities, Voices, and Experiences of U.S. Trans* Academics -- Being and Becoming Professionally Other: Identities, Voices, and Experiences of U.S. Trans* Academics is a path-clearing book that provides a rich, in-depth account of the lived experiences of 39 transgender or trans* academics. \n\n\n\n\nExcluding the Jew Within Us -- Why does anti-Semitism seem to be so deeply engrained in our societies, our institutions and our attitudes?  To answer this question we need to look beyond our current practices and see that anti-Semitism has much deeper roots - that it is woven into the very structures of Western thought. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Israel Against All Odds : Anti-Semitism From Its Beginnings to the Holocaust Years -- Jews are indisputably the most persecuted people in the annals of history. At the source of Jew-hatred in its myriad forms is anti-Semitism, a sinister and vile mindset that has existed since Old Testament times or for thousands of years. Anti-Semites pervade social, religious, economic and political confines, even mainstream Christianity, and their dislike for people of Jewish ancestry often translate into mindless persecution and slaughter, such as the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Second World War in the mid-twentieth century whereby over six million Jews met their deaths in the Holocaust.Anti-Semitism, instead of diminishing after the horrors of World War II, showed no sign of decline, and it seems as though the entire world, with a few exceptions like the Jewish nation of Israel itself and the United States of America, is at loggerheads with Jews. Even international peacekeeping and monitoring organizations like the United Nations (and its numerous spinoff groups) are known to discriminate, sometimes barefacedly, against Jews and Israel. Middle Eastern Arabs and Muslims harbor intense loathing for Israel and Jews, and notwithstanding their occupancy of over ninety-nine percent of Middle Eastern territories, seek to covet the less than one percent of land in which Israelis reside-by any means necessary.Despite the seemingly insurmountable hardships and challenges Jews have faced throughout the centuries, they persist and even progress in today's societies. They leave their enemies awe-struck at their resilience and their will to survive. It seems as though Israel and Jew, in general, enjoy a kind of divine providence. ISRAEL and Jews around the world continue to stand tall today-against all odds! \n\n\n\n\nPlant Lover's Guide to Hardy Geraniums -- Hardy geraniums are a perennial mainstay and are among the best loved and most widely grown plants.

Wine writers and scientists tell us much about varieties of wines, winegrowing estates, the commercial value and the biochemistry of wine, but seldom address the cultural, social, and historical conditions through which wine is produced and represented.  This path-breaking collection of essays by leading anthropologists looks not only at the product but also beyond this to disclose important social and cultural issues that inform the production and consumption of wine. The authors show that wine offers a window onto a variety of cultural, social, political and economic issues throughout the world. The global scope of these essays demonstrates the ways in which wine changes as an object of study, commodity and symbol in different geographical and cultural contexts. This book is unique in covering the latest ethnography, theoretical and ethnohistorical research on wine throughout the globe. Four central themes emerge in this collection: terroir; power and place; commodification and politics; and technology and nature. The essays in each section offer broad frameworks for looking at current research with wine at the core. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n American Wine Economics : An Exploration of the U.S. Wine Industry -- The U.S. wine industry is growing rapidly and wine consumption is an increasingly important part of American culture.

A significant but often misunderstood part of this history is the rise of Islamic opposition to the British in Mandate Palestine during the 1920s and 1930s. Across the empire, imperial officials wrestled with the question of how to rule over a Muslim-majority countries and came to see traditional Islamic institutions as essential for maintaining order. Islam under the Palestine Mandate tells the story of the search for a viable Islamic institution in Palestine and the subsequent invention of the Supreme Muslim Council. As a body with political recognition, institutional autonomy and financial power, the council was designed to be a counterweight to the growing popularity of nationalism among Palestinians. However, rather than extinguishing the revolutionary capacity of the colonized, it would become a significant opponent of British rule under its highly controversial president, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husayni. \n\n\n\n\nFoundations of Periodontics for the Dental Hygienist -- Comprehensive and easy-to-understand, Foundations of Periodontics for the Dental Hygienist, 4th Edition  offers up-to-date, evidence-based coverage of periodontal anatomy, the periodontal disease process, and classifications of periodontal disease. \n == SIMILAR TO == \n Wheater's Pathology: A Text, Atlas and Review of Histopathology -- This concise introduction to pathology covers basic pathological mechanisms and offers a detailed review of systems pathology, making it a complete, effective review for today's readers.
