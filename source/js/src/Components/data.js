The framework adopted to do this is model-centered learning, in which simulation is seen as particularly effective when learning requires a restructuring of the individual mental models of the students, as in conceptual change. Mental models are by themeselves simulations, and thus simulation models can extend our biological capacity to carry out simulative reasoning. For this reason, recent approaches in cognitive science like embodied cognition and the extended mind hypothesis are also considered in the book. A conceptual model called the \"epistemic simulation cycle\" is proposed as a blueprint for the comprehension of the cognitive activies involved in simulation-based learning and for instructional design.","author":"Author","url":"https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4899/9781489999658.jpg","year":"2015-04-08 00:00:00","id":"9781489999658"},{"name":"Candy Pink","desc":"The book created by Adela Turin 40 years ago to promote equality between boys and girls arrives for the first time in the United States.

Bev Cobain is Kurt's cousin, and this powerful book is her way of dealing with his death--and reaching out to teens with a life-saving message: You don't have to be sad, discouraged, or depressed. There is help and hope for you. Full of solid information and straight talk, When Nothing Matters Anymore defines and explains adolescent depression, reveals how common it is, describes the symptoms, and spreads the good news that depression is treatable. Personal stories, photos, and poetry from teens dealing with depression speak directly to readers' feelings, concerns, and experiences. Teens learn how to recognize depression in themselves and others, understand its effects, and take care of themselves by relaxing, exercising, eating right, and talking things over with people who care. For some teens, self-help isn't enough, so Bev also tells about treatment options, presents the facts about therapy, explains the differences between various types of helping professionals (psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, physicians, counselors, etc.), discusses medications, and more. This book isn't just for teens who have been diagnosed with depression. It's for any teen who feels hopeless, helpless, and alone.

Here is King--father, husband, politician, deal broker, idealist, pragmatist, inspiration to millions--brought to vivid, flesh-and-blood life. Out of print since 2006, King is Fantagraphics' most-requested reprint. In recognition of the advances made in American social equality that has made it possible to elect America's first black President, Fantagraphics Books is publishing King: The Special Edition, a newly designed volume that includes the original 240-page graphic biography, as well as nearly a hundred additional pages of \"extras,\" including: \"Black Dogs\" is a 14-page prelude to King, a dialogue between a young black couple expecting a child, living in LA in the aftermath of the Rodney King upheaval, a raw and inflected conversation between husband and wife and their racial attitudes in a post-King world; Excerpts from the diary and notebook the author kept when researching and writing King, with interstitial notes written specifically for this volume commenting on the method he used to conceived and execute the book; Preparatory sketches, discarded images and pages, an interview conducted at the time of the third volume's publication, and excerpts from the draft of the script; An epilogue titled \"Assassin,\" written and drawn for this new edition, in which Anderson explores the question of whether James Earl Ray actually shot King. Caroline Longstreet, one of the observers who comments on King's life throughout the book, is obsessed with the assassination, won't let it rest, and pursues her own private investigation and ultimately confronts the reasons why it's held her in its grip so long. Anderson's biography traces King's life from his childhood in Atlanta and his education at Booker T. Washington High School, and his subsequent centrality to the civil rights movement when, in 1955, he organized the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott; his founding of the Southern Christian leadership Conference in 1957; his Nobel Prize in 1964; his help in organizing the 1966 March on Washington and his \"I Have a Dream\" speech; and the tragic moment on April 4, 1968 when he was shot dead on the balcony of the Loraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. Anderson's expressionistic visual style is wrought with dramatic energy; panels evoke a painterly attention to detail but whose juxtapositions propel King's story with cinematic momentum. Anderson's successful use of the comics form to tell a major work of nonfiction has drawn favorable comparisons to Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale and Joe Sacco's Safe Area Gorazde: The War In Eastern Bosnia 1992-1995. King won a 1995 Parents' Choice Award.","author":"Author","url":"https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/6069/9781606993101.jpg","year":"2010-02-04 00:00:00","id":"9781606993101"},{"name":"The Children's Book of Healthy Habits","desc":"Help your child to discover that the world is a happier place if they have healthy habits!

Their friendship grows, and Daniel feels comfortable enough to talk to his new friend. Ryan's tendency to 'talk too much' enables him to help Daniel in the classroom, and he hopes for the day when his friend will be able to talk in school so that the other children may get to know the 'real' Daniel. In the meantime, he is willing to continue to be a friend to Daniel until that day. This beautifully illustrated story book is for children with severe shyness, social anxiety or selective mutism to see that they can make a friend like Ryan. It is also a helpful tool for friends of children like Daniel to understand why these children are unable to talk in certain settings.The theme - of accepting others who are different while trying to emphasise with them - is a universal one, and therefore this book may be enjoyed by all children aged from 4 to 8. While the story should not be read to the class while the child is present or without his or her permission, this book is an invaluable tool for teachers trying to understand selective mutism, and wanting to explain it to their students.  For comprehensive advice and information on selective mutism, please see \"The Selective Mutism Resource Manual\" (Speechmark, 2001).

The humour in the story is subtle and effective and unlike many 'stories with a message' written for children, this book is a pleasurable read in its own right, and stands up as a lovely story book, but with the added bonus of including the universal theme of 'being different' and in particular providing a basic explanation for selective mutism. I really loved this book'.'What really came through, is that it was written with real thought, care and from someone who really understands and empathises with the subject matter.

Throughout the poem there is a prevailing atmosphere of disorder and chaos, heightened by Carroll's characteristic use of 'portmanteau' words (such as 'uffish', 'beamish' and 'fumious') and descriptions of grotesque creatures such as the Bandersnatch and the Jubjub bird. The meaning of the poem, and of the Snark itself, has been the subject of much debate. In his preface Carroll said 'In answer to your question, 'What did you mean the Snark was?' will you tell your friend that I meant that the Snark was a Boojum. I trust that she and you will now feel quite satisfied and happy.'

In 1957, well before Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, Melba Pattillo Beals and eight other teenagers became iconic symbols for the Civil Rights Movement and the dismantling of Jim Crow in the American South as they integrated Little Rock's Central High School in the wake of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education.  Throughout her harrowing ordeal, Melba was taunted by her schoolmates and their parents, threatened by a lynch mob's rope, attacked with lighted sticks of dynamite, and injured by acid sprayed in her eyes. But through it all, she acted with dignity and courage, and refused to back down.  Warriors Don't Cry is, at times, a difficult but necessary reminder of the valuable lessons we can learn from our nation's past. It is a story of courage and the bravery of a handful of young, black students who used their voices to influence change during a turbulent time.","author":"Author","url":"https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4169/9781416948827.jpg","year":"2007-07-24 00:00:00","id":"9781416948827"},{"name":"Collins Easy Learning Spanish Dictionary","desc":"Collins Easy Learning Spanish Dictionary is an up-to-date, easy-reference dictionary with key GCSE curriculum words highlighted and a practical and fun supplement covering key vocabulary areas.

J.R.R. Tolkien's own description for the original edition: If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, over the edge of the Wild, and home again, and can take an interest in a humble hero (blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck), here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) -- if you do not already know all about these things -- much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period. For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare. They do not like noise.","author":"Author","url":"https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/3950/9780395071229.jpg","year":"1938-01-01 00:00:00","id":"9780395071229"},{"name":"The Story of the Snow Children","desc":"Poppy is gazing out of the window at the snow when suddenly she sees that the snowflakes are really Snow Children, dancing and whirling in the garden.
